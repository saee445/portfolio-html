        This is my first project in HTML, and it is a basic one that I completed within 24 hours. Although it's simple, it marks the beginning of my journey into web development. Apart from this, I have also created various projects using other programming languages like Python and C++. These projects have helped me enhance my coding skills and understand different aspects of software development.
