    I completed my schooling from 1st to 10th grade at N.D.M. School in Shindkheda (SNK). 
    It was a place where I built the foundation of my education and values. 
    The teachers were supportive and played a major role in shaping my learning journey. 
    I gained knowledge in various subjects and also took part in cultural and sports activities. 
    My time at N.D.M. School helped me grow both academically and personally. 
    It remains an important and memorable part of my life. </h6>

        After completing school, I pursued my 11th and 12th grades in the science stream at SSVPS College, Shindkheda.
        This phase helped me explore subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Mathematics, and more in depth.
        I successfully passed my 12th standard with 74%, which gave me confidence and motivation to continue further in the field of science.
